## About
Use this package to implement a Module structure within Laravel 5.5.
You can generate modules with their own Controllers, Models, Views, Translations, Routes and other files by the built in Artisan commands.
Modules and Plugins are automatically added to the `app/Modules` or `app/Plugins` folder respectively to speed up development and seperate your code into logical sections.
